# tcp-server
- The task was to create a server for automatic control of remote robots. Robots authenticate to the server and server directs them to origing of the coordinate system. For testing purposes each robot starts at the random coordinates and its target location is always located on the coordinate [0,0]. The robot should reach that target coordinate and pick the secret message, which can be found only on that spot. Server is able to navigate several robots at once and implements communication protocol without errors.
- This source code is only demonstration of my socket communication knowledges.
